      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is an open source software development for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run virtually anywhere on any type of server. Docker serves as a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization provided by traditional hypervisors. With a traditional hypervisor approach, each virtual machine (VM) needs its own operating system, however with Docker, applications operate inside a container that resides on a single host operating system that can serve many different containers.  Docker containers are lightweight by design and ideal for enabling microservices application development. Docker was originally built on top of Linux Containers.</p>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is an open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, and media streaming. Nginx was originally built as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.</p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>Virtual machine is a software computer that, similar to a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications. The virtual machine is consisted of a set of specification and configuration files and is backed by the physical resources of a host. Every virtual machine has virtual devices that provide the same functionality as physical hardware and have additional benefits in terms of portability, manageability, and security. VM is capable of performing tasks such as running applications and programs like a separate computer. A virtual machine, usually known as a guest is created within another computing environment referred to as a host. Multiple virtual machines can exist within a single host at one time.</p>
